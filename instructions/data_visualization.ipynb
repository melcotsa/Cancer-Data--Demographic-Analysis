        "1. Open data subset in Excel.\n",
        "2. Create a pivot table.\n",
        "3. Filter the pivot table.\n",
        "4. Create a graph based on the table.\n",

        "### Part 1: Getting Started\n",
        "1. Open the file \"chunk_SPDS_subset.csv\" found in the data folder of this repository.\n",
        "2. Download the `.csv` file and save it in an accessible place on your computer.\n",
        "3. Locate the `.csv` you just saved. Open in with Excel.\n",
        ">**On a MacBook this is done by right-clicking on the `.csv` in your Finder and pressing \"Open With\" > \"Microsoft Excel\"**\n",

        "5. Press the button \"Pivot Table\" found in the \"Insert\" tab on Excel.\n",
        "6. Pressing the Pivot Table button should automatically highlight the 2 columns \"sex\" and \"primary_diagnosis_site\". Click the \"okay\" to create the pivot table.\n",
        "7. Drop the \"primary_diagnosis_site\" filed into the Rows section. Drop \"sex\" into the columns section and the values section.\n",
