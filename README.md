# Cancer Data Repository
This repository contains data of cancer patients, intended to be used for analysis of diagnosis and outcome trends by demographic group. 

# What is in this repository?
#### The repository contains two `.csv` files under the ["data"](https://github.com/melcotsa/Cancer-Data--Demographic-Analysis/tree/main/data) folder: 
1. The raw cancer data sourced from the [Cancer Data Aggregator](https://cda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactive/) found via the [Cancer Research Data Commons](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/cancer-research-data-commons)
2. A subset of the data that only includes the sex of the patients and their primary diagnosis site. 
#### Additionally, the repository contains 2 instructional documents in the ["instructions"]( folder:
1. A Python notebook detailing how to create the aforementioned data subset from the raw data using Python3.
2. A document detailing how to create the data visualization/graph found later in this README file.

# Purpose
#### What can this data be used for?
- This data is a resource for scientists, or anyone, who is interested in cancer research and who wants to investigate cancer trends by demographic groups.
#### What might this data, and its analysis, show us?
- The data subset will outline the most common diagnoses of cancer patients by sex, which will allow scientists to see what cancers either sex is at higher risk for. This information can be incredibly useful for doctors and cancer advocates' preventative health measures.
